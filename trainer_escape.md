# Trainer Escape Glitch

This tutorial explains the process of setting up the trainer escape glitch (also known as Trainer-Fly or the Mew Glitch), as well as a simplified explanation of how the glitch works.

## Overview
The trainer escape glitch allows the player to interrupt the process of being spotted by a player. After battling another trainer to fix some side effects, returning to the map where the glitch was initiated will allow the player to battle a Pokémon with the index number matching the special stat of the last Pokémon fought.

## Setting up the glitch
There are two ways to initiate the trainer escape glitch: with a long-range trainer or with a death warp. We will examine each of these in turn.

### Method 1: Long-Range Trainer
Requirements:
1. An undefeated long-range trainer (more about what this means later)
2. Fly, Teleport, Dig, or an Escape Rope (depending on the area the long-range trainer is in)

A long-range trainer is a trainer such that it's possible for the player to enter the trainer's line of sight immediately after scrolling them on screen.

Here are some examples of long-range trainers:

This is not a long-range trainer because her line of sight is only three tiles long instead of four:

This is also not a long-range trainer because even though his line of sight extends to the edge of the screen, the cliff face prevents us from scrolling him onscreen at the same time he catches us:
